# Introduction

![](.gitbook/assets/headshot-128x128.png)

Hi there! I'm Ye Cheng. When I started writing on [my blog](https://cyyapye.com), I mostly wrote about the lessons I learned from reading and running engineering teams. But, occasionally, I also wrote about personal stories. Then, I realized the content is easier to consume if I separate the lessons from my personal stories.

Besides, I've always wanted to write a book no one wants to pay for. So, why not start now?

My plan is to write the book live in the open. So, what you'll see is raw notes slowly transformed into readable content as chapters are written. I have a rough idea about the skeleton of the book. Over time I expect to fill out the [content](https://theengineeringhandbook.com/ch) with the topics I want to cover.



### Guides: Jump right in

Follow our handy guides to get started on the basics as quickly as possible:

{% content-ref url="managing/giving-feedback.md" %}
[giving-feedback.md](managing/giving-feedback.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="managing/receiving-feedback.md" %}
[receiving-feedback.md](managing/receiving-feedback.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="managing/advanced-permissions.md" %}
[advanced-permissions.md](managing/advanced-permissions.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** your product docs aren't just a reference of all your features! use them to encourage folks to perform certain actions and discover the value in your product.
{% endhint %}

### Fundamentals: Dive a little deeper

Learn the fundamentals of MyProduct to get a deeper understanding of our main features:

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/projects.md" %}
[projects.md](fundamentals/projects.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/members.md" %}
[members.md](fundamentals/members.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/task-lists.md" %}
[task-lists.md](fundamentals/task-lists.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="fundamentals/tasks.md" %}
[tasks.md](fundamentals/tasks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Splitting your product into fundamental concepts, objects, or areas can be a great way to let readers deep dive into the concepts that matter most to them. Combine guides with this approach to 'fundamentals' and you're well on your way to great documentation!
