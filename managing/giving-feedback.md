# Giving feedback

feedback delivered effectively can dramatically impact lives. not many do it well. some are too brutally honest. others are too vague to be useful

here's how to give feedback and make it count:

1/ introspect yourself

are you invested in the receiver's growth? or are you giving feedback because it’s your job

unloading your responsibility and moving on regardless of the outcome is insincere

you can’t control the outcome. you can advise and create growth opportunities

2/ give feedback timely

we forget 50% of new information after 1h. 70% in 24h

don’t wait because the longer you wait the fewer details anyone can recall, the less time the receiver can react while it matters

feedback relevance decays faster than memory decay

if a colleague has kale stuck in his teeth, do you tell him before he goes on stage or do you wait till the next time you talk to him?

if you wait a month, the receiver starts wondering if you’re holding on to a war chest of feedback

3/ practice impromptu feedback

when possible give feedback in 2 mins, right after the event. while it's still fresh in everyone’s minds

impromptu feedback avoids the need for scheduled feedback. that means we can deliver feedback sooner, faster, and more often

this works especially well for praises. in my experience, constructive feedback tends to take longer because there’s usually back and forth

saving feedback for 1:1s is slow and unnatural. waiting that long also causes feedback to lose its relevance

4/ give feedback often

the more feedback we give, the more practice we get, the more natural we’re at it

make giving feedback the norm, not the exception we dread

each feedback we give shows we care about the receiver's growth and charges our trust battery a bit more

5/ give feedback to the receiver, not the manager

often we give feedback to the manager – especially when we work in two different functions – because we fear being disliked

to the receiver, this feels like back-stabbing. feedback should always flow through the shortest path

as a manager, i offer two choices to the giver:

* give the feedback directly to the receiver; or
* i'll give the feedback on your behalf because the giver may backpedal out of fear. in which case, both giver and receiver miss out on a growth opportunity

6/ write down the details

when the feedback is from a third party and you did not observe the event, writing it down improves recall and precision at delivery and avoids returning to the source when challenged

you can also share the written copy after delivering the feedback

specifics reinforce the validity of the feedback for both sides. the giver has to recall vivid details, improving accuracy in the process

we challenge the legitimacy of vague feedback, ultimately its truth. if the facts are shaky, we'll dismiss the feedback

7/ feedback is just one side of the story

feedback begins with one side expressing their frustration from their perspective. this is but one version of the story. it’s not the absolute truth

don’t assert the story as the only truth. the more assertive you’re, the more repulsive the feedback

we want our story heard too, even if some of the feedback is true. if you accept the feedback as the only truth, you’ve shut out the opportunity to discover the real truth

8/ listen to the receiver intently

a big part of giving feedback is listening after giving the feedback. imagine walking away right after

listening is empathy. it shows you're willing to understand the perspective of the receiver. it's the receiver's chance to tell their story

don't judge. restate in your own words to gain clarity

even mission serial killers believe their actions are justified. we are no exception. when robbed of the opportunity to tell our story, we too would reject other versions

9/ hold back advice until asked

some people need time to process. advice layered on top of feedback comes across as belaboring

before the receiver can act on the feedback, s/he must first accept s/he needs to change. otherwise, your advice won't land

once, the receiver told me he needed the weekend to digest and talk through with his wife. when he got back, he determined he wanted to change and asked for advice on how to approach the situation. we put a plan together and he crushed it

nb: his wife was the change agent

10/ don’t soften feedback

sandwiching criticism with praises is insincere and insulting. we imply the receiver is incapable of professionalism. when we prioritize our own likability over the receiver's growth, we're being selfish and manipulative

another form of feedback softening is by being vague. over-fuzziness dilutes the effectiveness of feedback

i used to do this a lot. it was more self-serving so i don’t feel like an asshole. depriving the receiver of actionable details is much worse

11/ focus on the receiver’s future growth

feedback is based on the past. we can't change the past. but the future is unwritten

don’t brush past the details and rush toward the future. we must converge on the facts before we can get to future corrections

growth comes from change. change comes from actions. draw up the action items to effect change together. offer to check in on the progress

you can change anything within your control if you will your mind to it. be the GOAT

12/ solicit feedback on your feedback

giving feedback is hard. rightfully uncomfortable. and we don’t get a lot of practice. seize every opportunity to get feedback on your feedback

we were too ambiguous. we gave too much context. our judgment and biases seeped through. these are good data points to help us improve

don’t ask “any feedback for me?” it lets ppl off the hook too easily w a “no”. ask “where am i falling short?” instead. and wait uncomfortably
