# Receiving feedback

receiving is always easier than giving, except when it comes to feedback

somehow we seem to always get in our way

buckle up. this is a deep, piercing thread on how to receive feedback



part 1: preparing yourself

before you can receive feedback, you have to dig deep into yourself to assess if you're ready



1/ do you think you're right?

the moment you do, you have entered into a power struggle

for you to be right, the opposing party must be wrong

your focus has turned from the rightness of the assertion to who is right

if you think you're right, you've given up all possibilities for discourse

because the case is closed. there's nothing else to debate

why do you so desperately need to be right?



2/ do you fear what others think of you?

we have been conditioned to want praise ever since we were kids

we live to satisfy others' expectations

if we did a good job, we expect gratitude and recognition

if i murdered someone, i'll go to prison

this puts our lives entirely in control of extrinsic incentives

what if the incentives disappear?

do we stop doing good deeds and start murdering people?

stop living for others. live for yourself

who is the ideal you? make that change now



3/ do you fear change?

we're funny creatures. we proclaim we welcome change for the better

yet when faced w an opportunity to change, we choose not to change

because we're terrified by what may come after

it's so much safer to stick to our present, familiar selves

when you receive feedback, do you fear change because by changing you're admitting fault? therefore, you lost? you're inferior? will you get passed for a promotion?

but what if you didn't change? how will you ever be the best version of you?



4/ your past has no bearing on your future

every feedback is an opportunity to chart a new path for your future

what's holding us back is "if only..."

if only i was better prepared, i'd have landed the job

if only she didn't push me that hard, i wouldn't have lost my temper

accept we didn't put in the work to prepare for the interview

accept we couldn't communicate without resorting to anger

then figure out how to improve and make the change

the v2 of you is the current best version of you until you choose to upgrade again



part 2: receiving feedback

once you have mustered the courage to change, you're ready for feedback



5/ don't judge the quality of the source, only the feedback

a giver has 3 paths to choose from

1 - the path of least resistance is to simply do nothing

2 - the worst path is to share your feedback w everyone but you

3 - the best and hardest path is to give you the feedback

why? could it be because a better you improves your interpersonal relationship?

self-serving? yes! but mutually beneficial too!

yet the giver cares enough to get uncomfortable and risk your blow-up



6/ say thank you. disagree later

thank you is to appreciate the giver for caring enough to take the risk and give you feedback

to encourage more feedback in the future

you can disagree, just not in the heat of the moment

you may change your opinion after you've had time to think on it

if you still disagree, first ask, "i disagree w the feedback. i'm happy to explain why if you like"



7/ don't challenge the feedback

most givers are not great at giving feedback

if the feedback lacks specifics, ask clarifying open-ended questions

can you share some specifics? vs when did i do that?

can you give me an example of that? vs are you sure that's what happened?

avoid leading yes/no questions because the giver may say yes just to move on, eg if i do X, that'll be better, right?



8/ check your ego, emotions, and title at the door

no matter how ridiculous the feedback may sound, there is some truth behind it

the truth could tell you something about yourself or how you're perceived by the giver

even if the perception is wrong, the fact remains that's how you're perceived

but if it's a perception shared by many, there may be a growth opportunity

you may choose to change to improve the perception or do nothing

mess it up, you'll likely never get feedback again



9/ write it down

take detailed notes so you can return to points that are unclear

once you have captured the specifics, restate in your own words to confirm your understanding

the goal is to fill out the situation, behavior, impact yourself

ask "did i get that right?"

the best thing you can do when receiving feedback is to listen intently

be genuinely curious and gather all the facts that'll help you discover the truth about yourself

part 3: the transformation

armed w facts gathered from the feedback, it's time to uncover the truth about yourself



10/ seek the truth

use 5-whys to debug the situation

why did you raise your voice at bruce?

why were you angry?

why did you want bruce to submit to you?

why couldn't you get bruce to listen?

why did you have to be right?

the root causes will inform the necessary action items to effect change

11/ chart your path to the new you

create action items to change

make a commitment to the giver

ask for help from the giver to hold you accountable

share your feedback openly to precondition others about your reaction to feedback

i once shared my feedback to the entire org in my weekly digest when i screwed up



12/ follow through

complete the action items you committed to

this is the most important and rewarding part of receiving feedback

you will shed the old you and usher in the new you

you are now the best version of yourself until the next feedback

part 4: going back for more

knowing how feedback can shape you can be intoxicating. hone your skills to get more feedback



13/ ask for feedback

just like giving feedback, you have to get uncomfortable to get solid feedback

avoid asking yes/no questions, eg "any feedback for me?"

ask "where am i falling short?" and wait until you get constructive, high-signal feedback

don't let the giver off easily w "oh, you did great!"

press on w "there must be something i can improve on"

"i'm going to have to really think on it" is good. just keep your mouth shut

the only way out of the uncomfortable silence is constructive, high-quality feedback



14/ give to get

to build a feedback culture, lead by example

practice giving feedback until it comes naturally

if someone's holding back on feedback, it's an opportunity to give feedback

this is how a culture is built â€“ by instilling the behavior you want

take a stand, and never waiver
