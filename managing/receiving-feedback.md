# Receiving feedback

embrace a growth mindset

failures are learning opportunities, not a definition of who you are

your future is unwritten



don't judge the quality of the source. only the feedback

giver cares enough to be uncomfortable and risk your blow up



don't challenge the feedback

most givers are not great at giving feedback

if the feedback lacks specifics, ask clarifying open ended questions, eg

can you share some specifics? vs when did i do that?

can you give me an example of how i can improve? vs&#x20;

avoid leading yes/no questions because the giver may say yes just to move on, eg if i do X, that'll be better, right?



write it down

take detailed notes so you can return to points that are unclear

once you have captured the specifics, restate in your own words to confirm your understanding

the goal is to fill out the situation, behavior, impact yourself

ask "did i get that right?"



say thank you. disagree later

thank you is to appreciate the giver for caring enough to take the risk and give you feedback

to encourage more feedback in the future

you can disagree, just not in the heat of the moment

you may change your opinion after you've had time to think on it

if you still disagree, first ask, "i disagree w the feedback. i'm happy "



check you ego, leave the title at the door

mess it up, you'll likely never get feedback again



check your emotions

no matter how ridiculous the feedback may sound, there is a truth hiding behind all that

the truth could tell you something about yourself or how you're perceived by the giver

even if the perception is wrong, the fact remains that's how you're perceived



seek the truth

use 5-whys to debug the situation

ask yourself why&#x20;



ask for feedback

provide a template for better feedback



share your feedback openly to precondition others about your reaction to feedback

i once shared my feedback to the entire org in my weekly digest when i screwed up



lead by example



celebrate criticism

this is the behavior you want to instill



give to get

give feedback well, see giving feedback thread



create action items to change

make a commitment to the giver

ask for help from the giver to hold you accountable



follow through

make the change

this is the most important and rewarding part of receiving feedback

this will change you, an upgraded you
